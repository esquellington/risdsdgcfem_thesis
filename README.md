# risdsdgcfem_thesis

This repository contains most of the code developed during my PhD thesis
"Robust Interactive Simulation of Deformable Solids with Detailed
Geometry using Corotational FEM".

In its present state it's probably useless for anybody but myself. It
is only intended for archiving and future reference, and will not be
developed any further.
